# MACD Indicator Analysis (Python)

A short project completed during the **Computer Science studies** for the **Numerical Methods** course.  
It presents a technical and visual analysis of the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) stock market indicator.

This project uses real-world historical data from Royal Gold Inc. (RGLD) to calculate and evaluate a basic MACD-based trading strategy.  
It includes data loading, EMA/MACD calculations, chart generation, and a basic implementation of **Trailing Stop Loss (TSL)**.
